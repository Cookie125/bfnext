the mission name and path much match the one in the json.
for example C:\test.miz
you must have test.json inside of C:\, so that C:\test.json and C:\test.miz both exist. this requirement is just to make sure we have both.
the miz path must also be defined in the JSON, but it will actually use w/e you put in there.

weapon and radio templates should go in the weapon template field (pulled from the same miz).
